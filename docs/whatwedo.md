# What We Do

**_New Text's_** clients are continuously looking for better information &mdash; more accurate, _closer-to-the-truth_ information about what people are doing, desiring, and buying (commercially and otherwise). We find that information and then package it smartly for our clients.

## The Problem

What began as a seismic improvement in information retrieval, the internet &mdash; **surface, deep, and dark** &mdash; has, in some ways, become better at obstructing the truth. Yet even now too many people are indiscriminately scraping it and attempting to use defective data.

## _Quid est veritas_?

The overwhelming desire among individuals, companies, and governments to hide the truth about any given matter has muddied the internet's waters. The cynics among them will 'justify' their obfuscations imitating Pilate's rhetoric.

## The Truth

But what we have found and live by is that _error_, even when its propagators occupy the field of information, give something of the truth away. That is, the truth lurks even there, ready to be discovered. So much so that the determined, thoughtful, and smart human being can find it &mdash; especially when he or she is equipped with the right technology.

## Our Methods

We use various methods, all of which fall under that misleading but current acronym _AI_, to uncover for our clients what the reality is, to their great reward.

The efforts at _mis_ information &mdash; misuse and abuse of _'what is'_ &mdash; is destructive but not insurmountable.

**New Text Corp** overcomes the lie's barriers. We very much subscribe to Aristotle's reminder: _the human being by nature grasps for truth_.

Doing it correctly can be quite rewarding, commercially and otherwise.
